## Queer Fans Deserve Data

Our story of fandom, passion, code and the desire to see fair and positive LGBTQ representation on television. LezWatch.TV is an online database and queer entertainment news site created by two TV-obsessed lesbian web developers to catalog and document queer female, transgender and nonbinary characters, and their corresponding shows from TV, web, and streaming media with the goal of providing free and easy access to information on the best shows with queer characters and shows in the genres fans want to see. We will also present analysis on the current and future state of representation from the data we have collected.

How can data help with the current state of queer representation in the media? LezWatch.TV, an online database and queer entertainment news site, was started by two TV-obsessed lesbian web developers with the intention of cataloging and documenting queer female, transgender, and nonbinary characters, and their corresponding shows from TV, web, and streaming media. With that data, statistics are calculated on the state of international queer story representation, with the goal of providing free and easy access to information on the best shows with queer characters and stories in the genres fans want to see. LezWatch.TV is a story of fandom, passion, code, and the desire to see fair, equal, and positive representation for people like us on television.
