We became friends, met up at WordCamps's, started chatting online. Encyclopedic knowledge of queer TV. Would watch anything with gay in it. For Example.

					<h1>Shows and Characters</h1>

					<p>What makes it worth your time?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: I think that data on it's own can be really boring. You have to give it context to give it meaning. What goes into making a show subjectively watchable?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Shows</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Are the queers real?</li>
						<li>Are the queers happy?</li>
						<li>Do the queers have screentime?</li>
						<li>What seasons/episodes should you watch?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: Not everything on the best shows is worth watching. Let's grab the notable and highlight it: Callie and Arizona's wedding on Grey's or when Alex and Maggie kiss for real for the first time on Supergirl.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Characters</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>What is their gender identity?</li>
						<li>What is their sexual orientation?</li>
						<li>What actors portray them?</li>
						<li>What shows are they on?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: Characters are connected to shows, letting us handle people like Sara Lance. We'll come back to her.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>The Nitty Gritty</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Tropes - What common situations/plots are found on a show?</li>
						<li>Clichés - What common types of characters are we seeing?</li>
						<li>Stations - Where can you watch this show?</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: Tropes: Bury Your Queers, Coming Out, Bisexual Love Triangle, Babies<br>
						Clichés: Addict, Bartender, Prisoner, Closeted<br>

					<ul>
						<li>Character Roles: Main, Recurring or Guest?</li>
						<li>Character Death Date: When did they die?</li>
						<li>Nations: Where did this originate from?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: We realized we were missing important data. Things people were looking for to give context. Like it was one thing to know Sara Lance died. It was another to know all the times.

					<h1>2016</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Show Stars: Gold, Silver or Bronze?</li>

						<li>Show Formats: TV shows or web series or what?</li>
						<li>Show Genres: What kind of show is this?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: We started to identify the good and the bad about shows. If queers made a show, we should indicate and celebrate that. If a show did some horrific things *cough* The 100 *cough* we should warn people.

						<li>Shows We Love: If we think everyone should watch a show, we love it</li>
						<li>Romantic Orientation: Optional for characters who have this</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: We wanted to let people know what shows WE love. Also adding in webseries, which are more flexible and open with sexuality and representation meant we needed to account for more diversity in characters.

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: I mentioned actors in v1 of the data architecture. They were a text field where we typed in the actor's name. No continuity, becaue besides not having a gaydar, I can't spell, and it was not robust enough to do what we wanted.

						A system to recognize when shows are made for us.

				<section>
					<h2>Gold <i class="fas fa-star gold"></i></h2>

					<p>
						Openly queer creators with a majority queer characters, out queer actors and stories made for a queer female audience.
					</p>

					<p>
						Examples: <strong><em>The L Word</em></strong>, <strong><em>Take My Wife</em></strong> and <strong><em>Pose</em></strong>.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: Gold star here means you're super duper queer, in front of and behind the camera, making things for queer female viewers.

				<section>
					<h2>Silver <i class="fas fa-star silver"></i></h2>

					<p>
						Openly queer creators with queer characters and stories made for a queer female audience. May have no out queer actors, but has a significant number of stories geared towards a non-queer female audience.
					</p>

					<p>
						Examples: <strong><em>Queer As Folk</em></strong>, <strong><em>Steven Universe</em></strong> and <strong><em>RED</em></strong>.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: The silver star is still EXTRA queer. They're aimed at queers in general, but not exclusively.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Bronze <i class="fas fa-star bronze"></i></h2>

					<p>
						Openly queer creators, some queer characters and stories OR made for a general audience. Also used for shows focused on a queer main character and their stories, but has no out queers involved with production or acting.
					</p>

					<p>
						Examples: <strong><em>Sense8</em></strong>, <strong><em>American Horror Story</em></strong> and <strong><em>Janet King</em></strong>.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: The Bronze Star is for queer shows that are made for everyone. I like to point at Sense8 here, becuase it's a great show, made by wonderful, talented, queer people, but it's not a queer show like Queer as Folk. It's for EVERYONE on purpose.

					<blockquote>
						The concept that oppressive institutions (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia, classism, etc.) are interconnected and cannot be examined separately from one another.

						Mika: It's messy here, but we're trying to come to terms with how GOOD character rep is, relative to the different stakes in a TV movie versus a full series.

						Mika: Math nerds, rejoice! You may notice, you can have a negative transgender score if the majority of your transgender characters are NOT played by transgender actors. If you have 4 transgender characters and all are played by cis actors, you would actually have a -4 times 2, for -8 points.

					<h2>Character Scores Formula</h2>

					<ul>

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: The reason we adjust things here is because we grade on a curve. It's EASIER for web series and TV movies to include queer characters, so they need to work a little harder to be as awesome as a show that puts on 20 episodes a year.

					<p>
						A show featuring Latinx queer women, created, written and produced by Latinx queer women.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">

						First transgender superhero played by out transgender actress Nicole Maines.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: Supergirl's a problematic fav in many ways, but they're also the first superhero show to give us a transgender superhero. Plus they went the extra mile and made her gender a part of the story, validating so much.

				<section data-background="img/abby.jpg">

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: In Thursday's epsiode she actually talked about how being Cuban impacted her, coming out and dealing with her family, why she behaved in certain ways. I'm not spoiling anything. Go watch it.

					<aside class="notes">

					<h1>Representation Matters</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						Mika: But. We are not where we need to be in terms of Queer rep on TV. When you immerse a person in media where they don't see themselves it's harmful. It's no better when you put the characters in the background or kill them off.
