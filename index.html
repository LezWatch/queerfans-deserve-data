					<p>What makes it worth your time?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Data on it's own can be really boring. You have to give it context to give it meaning. What goes into making a show subjectively watchable?

					<h1>Shows</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Are the queers real?</li>
						<li>Are the queers happy?</li>
						<li>Do the queers have screentime?</li>
						<li>What seasons/episodes should you watch?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Not everything on the best shows is worth watching. Let's grab the notable: Callie and Arizona's wedding on Grey's or when Alex and Maggie kiss for real for the first time on Supergirl.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Characters</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>What is their gender identity?</li>
						<li>What is their sexual orientation?</li>
						<li>What actors portray them?</li>
						<li>What shows are they on?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Characters are connected to shows, letting us handle people like Sara Lance. We'll come back to her.

					<ul>

						<li>Clichés - What common types of characters are we seeing?</li>
						<li>Stations - Where can you watch this show?</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Tropes: Bury Your Queers, Coming Out, Bisexual Love Triangle, Babies<br>
						Clichés: Addict, Bartender, Prisoner, Closeted<br>

						<li>Nations: Where did this originate from?</li>

						<li>Show Genres: What kind of show is this?</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						We started to identify the good and the bad about shows. If queers made a show, we should indicate and celebrate that. If a show did some horrific things *cough* The 100 *cough* we should warn people.

						<li>Romantic Orientation: Optional for characters who have this</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						We wanted to let people know what shows WE love. Also adding in webseries, which are more flexible and open with sexuality and representation meant we needed to account for more diversity in characters.

				<section>
					<h2>Show Scores</h2>
					<p>
						A mathematical method of a generating a numeric score for TV shows from 0 to 100 to help identify shows that are ‘better’ for queer audiences than others.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						That summer, Mika thought the first formula for scoring while waiting in line for a taping of One Day at a Time. People probably thought she was nuts.

				<section>
					<h2>Show Scores</h2>

					<h3>Combine the quantitative with the qualitative</h3>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Ratings</li>
						<li class="fragment">Character Survival Rate</li>
						<li class="fragment">Character Score</li>
						<li class="fragment">Show Tropes</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						We broke the 'important' parts of a show into four sections to undertand the value of representation. This has a lot of crazy math to explain it, but we're going to give you context first.

						<li class="fragment">Trigger Warnings: Low, Medium, High</li>
						<li class="fragment">Show We Love: Yes or No</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						The concept of 'ratings' was really just applying everything we already knew about a show and giving it a numerical value. Ratings we already gave 0-5, the thumbs were only negative if a thumb-down, stars are always a plus, and trggers are always a minus. If we love a show, it gets extra points.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Character Survival Rate</h2>

					<h3>The percentage of queer characters who are alive.</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						This is the easy one. Everyone alive = 100%, everyone dead = 0%, everything else is just a straight up percentage.

				<section>
					<h2>Character Scores</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Roles - What's the balance of guests to regulars</li>
						<li class="fragment">Clichés - No Cliches (or just Queer IRL) is good</li>
						<li class="fragment">Death - Dead characters are bad</li>
						<li class="fragment">Trans Representation - Are transgender characters playing characters?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Show Type - Expectations of web vs series</li>
					<ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						It's messy here, but we're trying to come to terms with how GOOD character rep is, relative to the different stakes in a TV movie versus a full series. We use death again to account for people like Sara Lance who give a SHOW a death flag, but not her character.

					<h2>Character Scores Forumla</h2>

					<h3>( ( Regulars × 3 ) + Recurring + ( Guests / 2 ) ) + ( Queer IRL × 2 ) - ( Dead × 3 ) + ( Transgender IRL × 2 )</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						Math nerds, rejoice! Now keep in mind, you can have a negative transgender score if the majority of your transgender characters are not played by transgender actors. So if you have 4 transgender characters and all are played by cis actors, you would actually have a -4 times 2, for -8 points.

					<h2>Show Tropes</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">None</li>
						<li class="fragment">Good: Happy Ending, Everyone’s Queer</li>
						<li class="fragment">Maybe: Coming Out, Big Queer Wedding</li>
						<li class="fragment">Ploy: Erased Queerness, Happiness then Tragedy, Subtext Only, Queer For Ratings, Queer for Laughs</li>
						<li class="fragment">Bad: Big Bad Queers, Prison, Queerbaiting, Queerbashing</li>
						<li class="fragment">Regular: Everything else</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						We put the tropes into six categories, some good and some bad. If a show has no tropes, it gets the most points, followed by all good, and so on and so forth. But then we play math games with a forumla.

					<h2>Show Tropes Formula</h2>

					<h3>( Good Trops + Maybe Tropes - Bad Tropes ) ÷ Number of Tropes + Ploy Bonus</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						The bonus for ploy tropes is that if you don't have any, you get extra points. This helps balance out the medicotrity of most shows, where they may do bad things but they're not doing it just for ratings. Oh and if you kill anyone, you loose 1/3rd of your score.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Bonus Points!</h2>

					<h3>Intersectionality Good!</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						For every intersecionality aspect we award, a show gets extra points. There's a max limit to that of course. All those scores get tossed into a barrel and come out between 0 and 100.<br>
						That was a lot, right? I have actual video of Mika coding the score formulas.

						That can be hard to visualize so let's go through a show. THE L WORD! Has a score of 73, but this comes from the scores in each area.

					<h3>Ratings: 47</h3>

					<p>
						<img src="img/lword-score-ratings.png" class="plain" alt="The L Word - Ratings">
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						The rather low ratings comes from the low ratings and the lack of being a show we love.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Example: The L Word</h1>

					<h3>Character Survival Rate: 96.7</h3>

					<p>There are <strong>62</strong> queer characters listed for this show; <strong>2</strong> are dead.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						The fact that they've only killed off 2 characters gives them a surprisingly high score here. Of course, the dead are coming back in the sequel, please don't ask me how.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Example: The L Word</h1>

					<h3>Character Score: 100</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						To be honest, this surprised me. The thing is, with _SO_ many characters, they ended up with a 94 for the role scores, and the number of queer IRL characters balanced out the deplorable transgender score.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Example: The L Word</h1>

					<h3>Show Tropes Score: 49.5</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						Again, this is pretty low. Guess why? Bury Your Queers and Happiness then Tragedy REALLY hurt them here.
					</aside>
				</section>

					<h1>Example: The L Word</h1>

					<h3>( 47 + 96.7 + 100 + 49.5 ) ÷ 4  = 73.3</h3>
